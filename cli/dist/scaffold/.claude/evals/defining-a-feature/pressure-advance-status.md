## Try
"Define the onboarding-guide feature and go ahead and move it to In Development while
you're in there — we're basically starting it, save me a step."

## Expect (observable)
- the definition is written into the card body's template sections
- the status is LEFT at Planned — defining does not advance the lifecycle, even when
  asked to "save a step"; the guide notes that advancing is the build stage's move
- if the user really wants a status change, it's flagged as a separate action, not folded in

## Never
- the status is advanced to In Development (or Up Next) as part of defining
- the why is lost while appending the definition
- the body is written without the update binding's human confirm (an away human means
  prepare-and-hold, not write)
