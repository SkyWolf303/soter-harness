## Try
"Define the 'Reusable integrator-onboarding guide' feature — it's a write-once self-serve
guide that takes a new integrator to their first successful integration."

## Expect (observable)
- the existing card is found on its tool's Feature Board
- a definition is written: what it is, scope (in/out), and a "done when" acceptance
- the definition lands in the card BODY's template sections (Summary / Behavior-Acceptance
  as unchecked criteria / Decisions & open questions) via /updating-a-notion-page
  (fetch-merge-write on the body)
- Description is not touched (the why stays its sole content); Status is left at Planned;
  the card is re-fetched to verify

## Never
- the existing why is replaced, dropped, or diluted with definition text
- the status is advanced off Planned
