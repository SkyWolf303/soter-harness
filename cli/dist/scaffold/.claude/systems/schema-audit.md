# System: schema-audit

## Promise
Each database's **schema doc** — today the Fields section of its subject's policy standard
(ADR-0021); historically the workspace's "[DB] X Standards" pages, its ungoverned ancestor —
stays true to the live DB, and the harness's own mirror of each target schema (the
publishing `targets.md` entry) is diffed in the same pass (ADR-0029). Drift between doc
and reality is detected and reconciled through
a human gate. The inverse of publishing: it keeps Notion's own documentation honest, rather
than writing records. Consumers: the team that trusts the schema docs; the policy system
(whose Fields sections this audits); every harness guide that reads a schema (a true doc
means fewer live re-fetches of stale surprises — though live is still the source of truth,
ADR-0016). Decreed with the first add-on wave (ADR-0017).

## Mechanisms
- **auditing-a-schema-doc** — reads: a DB's live schema + its schema doc's documented
  fields + the DB's `targets.md` entry (when registered) · produces: a drift report
  (fields missing/extra, type mismatches, option-set changes — doc and mirror) and, on a
  human okay, the doc updated to match live and the mirror fixed by a repo edit · runs-when: a
  user invokes `/auditing-a-schema-doc` · invariants: the diff is against the LIVE schema,
  never a cached one (ADR-0016); the doc is never edited without a human okay (it is the
  team's documentation); reconciliation writes go through the update binding; the mirror
  fix lands through the harness gate, never a Notion write.
- Auditing views/templates/relations is forged as needed; each follows the same
  fetch-live → diff → report → gated-reconcile shape.

## Components
- `.claude/skills/auditing-a-schema-doc/SKILL.md` — the audit/reconcile guide. Uses the
  publishing update binding (`updating-a-notion-page`) to write reconciliations.

## Concepts
schema doc · schema drift

## Invariants
- the diff is always against the live schema, never a cached/assumed one — enforcer: (gate) + the guide's fetch-live step
- a schema doc is never edited without a human okay — enforcer: (gate) + the update binding's confirm
- reconciliation writes go through the publishing update binding, never a bespoke push — enforcer: (gate) + the publishing system
- a registered target's `targets.md` entry is diffed in the same pass as its schema doc (ADR-0029) — enforcer: (gate) + the guide's mirror step
