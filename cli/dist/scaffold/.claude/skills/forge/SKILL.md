  Authors a new harness piece — guide, rule, standard, mold, or system — from its
  mold, with evals, a pressure test, and the human gate. Use when the user says forge
  or asks to add a guide, rule, standard, or system to the harness. Not for editing
  existing pieces, standalone decisions (/writing-adrs), or bulk changes.

# Forge — authoring a harness piece

## Goal
A new piece merged **staged**: template-shaped, Checker-clean, with ≥3 eval cases
(one a pressure case), pressure-tested by fresh eyes, and human-approved.

## Use when / don't use when
- Use when: the user invokes `/forge` to add a guide, rule, standard, mold, or system.
- Not for: editing existing pieces (small edits go straight to a PR); standalone
  decisions (`/writing-adrs` — though a forge run may *produce* ADRs along the way);
  inlining org-specific data into a generic kernel/core piece (keep those generic —
  context/automation add-ons ARE forgeable, ADR-0012); bulk operations (needs a plan first).

## Steps
1. **Clarify.** Classify first — run the classification rule in `.claude/LEXICON.md`
   (kind · system · layer · mold) — then name and scope. Ask only what's unclear.
   FLEX: naming and scope, within `.claude/rules/authoring.md` conventions.
   A **new SYSTEM** branches to ADR-0017's path instead of the eval loop: a born-or-
   decreed ADR (via `/writing-adrs`) + the card from the system-card mold + its concepts
   registered in the LEXICON — no evals or pressure-test (a card doesn't execute). Steps
   2, 7, and 9 still apply (territory, checker, gate), and the card must cite its birth
   ADR (checker `CARD_ADR`).
2. **Territory check.** Read the CLAUDE.md guide index and every existing piece's
   exclusion clause. Overlap found → stop and propose extending that piece instead.
3. **Sandbox.** Create a worktree on branch `forge/<name>`. Nothing touches main.
4. **Baseline (RED).** Before drafting, dispatch a fresh-context subagent on the
   pressure scenario *without* the piece (dispatch-and-judge mechanics per
   `/running-evals`: neutral prompt, `eval-runner` containment, artifact verdicts). Record what it actually does wrong and the
   rationalizations it produces. No observed failure → stop: the piece may not be
   needed. ("If you didn't watch an agent fail without it, you don't know it teaches
   the right thing.")
5. **Draft.** Copy the mold from `.claude/templates/`, fill every section, delete all
   hints. Follow `.claude/RUBRIC.md`. The draft must counter the baseline's observed
   rationalizations — list them in Gotchas with counters. Rationale that needs
   preserving → a new ADR, not prose.
6. **Evals.** For a **guide**, write ≥3 cases in `.claude/evals/<name>/`: happy path,
   **pressure case** (realistic stakes tempting a shortcut), invariant ("must never").
   Rules, standards, and molds carry no eval requirement — their shape IS the check
   (see the placement table in `.claude/LEXICON.md`).
7. **Check.** Run `node .claude/scripts/check.mjs --all`; fix until 0 errors.
8. **Pressure-test.** Dispatch a **fresh-context subagent** with only the draft and
   the pressure scenario — never the drafting conversation (mechanics per
   `/running-evals`). Verify it *uses* the
   piece and *complies* with its steps. Confusion or noncompliance → fix the draft,
   record the gotcha, re-test.
9. **Human gate.** Present: the draft, the baseline (RED) evidence, the eval list, and
   the pressure-test result. Redlines → apply, re-run steps 7-8, re-present. Okay →
   merge, remove worktree.
10. **Land staged.** The new piece keeps `disable-model-invocation: true` and stays
   out of the guide index. Promotion (auto-invocation + index entry) happens only
   after it proves itself in real use — a separate, explicit decision.

## Verification
Merged piece passes `check.mjs --all`; its eval cases exist; the pressure-test
transcript showed compliance; the human okay is the merge itself (git provenance).

## Gotchas
- 2026-07-09 (run 1, writing-adrs): the Checker's placeholder scan can false-positive on
  strings that are notation in one context and mold-residue in another (e.g. "ADR-XXXX"
  in a guide about ADRs). Fix the Checker's scoping; don't contort the draft's wording.
- 2026-07-09 (run 1): pressure/invariant tests leave REAL artifacts in the worktree — a
  compliant agent will faithfully write the test's bait content into live files (a fake
  decision nearly entered the log). Before merge: revert bait artifacts, keep only ones
  that are genuinely true. Better: make test scenarios out of real work you want anyway.
- Timing note: step 3 creates the worktree *before* drafting (sandbox-first) —
  deliberate; nothing should ever draft on main.
- (live 2026-07-14) System creation had NO owning procedure — this guide's scope didn't
  cover system cards, so births were freestyle-consistent-with-precedent, and three
  add-on cards never cited their decree. Counter: step 1's system branch + `CARD_ADR`.
- (research 2026-07-15) A baseline scenario a bare agent can trivially satisfy produces a
  FALSE verdict either way — agents only lean on guidance for tasks they can't easily do
  alone, so a shallow prompt yields GREEN without proving coverage, and a leading prompt
  yields RED without proving need. Make the baseline substantive: multi-step, realistic
  stakes, containing the specific failure the piece would exist to prevent.
