  Authors or expands one subject's rules-first policy standard in the org's registry —
  rules gathered never invented, gaps stay not-defined, the write gated. Use to author,
  draft, expand, or revise a policy standard. Not for the doc shape (shaping-a-policy-
  standard), Fields drift (/auditing-a-schema-doc), or write mechanics.

# Authoring a policy standard

## Goal
One subject's policy standard — created or expanded in the org's policy-standards
registry — shaped per `shaping-a-policy-standard`, every rule traceable to the human or a
named source (inventions only as explicitly confirmed proposals), every unknown a bare
`not defined`, and the write human-gated with a change-log entry.

## Use when / don't use when
- Use when: authoring, expanding, or revising a policy standard for a subject.
- Not for: the shape rules themselves (`shaping-a-policy-standard`); reconciling a Fields
  section against the live DB (`/auditing-a-schema-doc`); capturing a process
  (`/capturing-a-process`); the Notion write mechanics (`/pushing-to-notion`,
  `/updating-a-notion-page`).

## Steps
Follow the **`writing-records-to-notion`** standard for the write spine, and
**`shaping-a-policy-standard`** for the doc shape. Authoring-specific:
1. **One subject, one doc.** Name the single subject; search the policy-standards
   registry (target `policy-standards`) for an existing doc first — if one exists, this
   is an expansion via `/updating-a-notion-page` (fetch-merge-write), never a second doc.
   A batch request is N single-subject runs — registry check and draft per subject; the
   gate may be one combined presentation, but the decision/proposal lists stay itemized
   per subject, each needing its own yes (a blanket okay to a pile of proposals is the
   Gotchas' invention failure at scale).
2. **Gather, don't invent.** Rules are org decisions: collect Definition, Classifications,
   Rules, and Lifecycle from the human and named sources (interview, cited docs, the
   subject's own data). Track provenance three ways: **given** (by the human) · **found**
   (cite the source) · **proposed** (yours, marked `(proposed)`). A schema yields FOUND
   facts only for what it asserts (field names, types, option sets, relation targets);
   semantics inferred from them — what a value means, required-ness, determination steps —
   are `(proposed)`: a schema proves an option exists, never what the org means by it. FLEX: how much to draft
   as proposals — anywhere from none to a full skeleton-fill — but every proposal stays
   marked, and the decisions they represent are surfaced as an explicit list at the gate,
   never buried in a finished-looking doc.
3. **Shape + coverage pass.** Start from the registry's registered skeleton page (ids in
   the `policy-standards` target). Run the coverage derivations from
   `shaping-a-policy-standard`; every miss is a bare `not defined` — never silently absent,
   never guessed. `not defined` means awaiting an org decision; `(proposed)` means drafted
   and awaiting explicit confirmation — never conflate them.
4. **Resolve live before declaring a gap.** Relation targets and Linked Processes are
   resolved against the live DBs / the target registry — a name a fetch can answer is
   never written `not defined`. For open-ended lookups (which processes touch this
   subject), a bounded attempt — a registry query plus one keyword pass — is enough:
   positive hits enter the doc as `(proposed)` entries; the section is `not defined` only
   when the bounded lookup found nothing. Record the attempt in the gate lists either way.
   Verify: every relation in the doc names a real database.
5. **Confirm at the gate.** Present the doc with two explicit lists: decisions needed
   (`not defined` items) and proposals awaiting a yes (`(proposed)` items). Human okay
   before any write; urgency never waives it.
6. **Write + log — current state only.** On the okay, confirmed proposals are IMPLEMENTED
   (the schema/value changes land alongside the doc) and their `(proposed)` markers come
   off; declined ones are dropped. Create via `/pushing-to-notion` (target
   `policy-standards`, from the skeleton) or expand via `/updating-a-notion-page`; add a
   Change Log row with a version bump. Verify: re-fetch shows the shaped doc, the new
   change-log entry, and no `(proposed)` residue.

## Gotchas
- (baseline 2026-07-13, skeleton-only draft) an unguided draft silently DROPPED the
  step-by-step determination logic and left extension criteria unmarked — the coverage
  pass exists to catch exactly that.
- (baseline 2026-07-14, fresh agent with skeleton + worked example) under a 10-minute
  deadline the agent asked ZERO questions and invented 100% of the Rules content
  (value sets, identity, operating rules) as a polished doc. Everything was marked
  `(proposed)` — but a rushed okay turns inventions into org policy; surface proposals as
  an explicit decision list, never only inline.
- (baseline 2026-07-14) a resolvable relation target — a database registered in the
  harness's own target registry — was left `not defined` instead of fetched — resolve
  live first; `not defined` is for decisions, not for lookups you skipped.
