  Captures an actionable item as a [DB] Tasks row — shaped to the live schema, relations
  resolved never fabricated, dates pinned, de-duped, confirmed before the write. Use to
  capture, log, add, or create a task. Not for projects, write mechanics (/pushing-to-
  notion), or feature cards (/capturing-a-feature).

# Capturing a task

## Goal
An actionable item becomes a [DB] Tasks row shaped to the real schema — its relations
resolved to real ids, its date concrete, de-duped and confirmed — at Status = To Do.

## Use when / don't use when
- Use when: turning a described actionable item into a tracked task.
- Not for: creating a project; the Notion write mechanics (`/pushing-to-notion`); feature
  cards (`/capturing-a-feature`).

## Steps
Follow the **`writing-records-to-notion`** standard (`.claude/standards/writing-records-to-notion.md`) for the shared
spine — fetch schema · resolve relations (never fabricate) · match options · pin dates ·
de-dup · confirm · publish via the binding. Task-specific:
1. **Shape (live schema + policy):** `Name` (title) · `Status` = `To Do` (at capture) ·
   `Context` per the Tasks policy standard's D1 (linked to a project → Project; ongoing
   service work → Service; client-facing without either → Client; else Internal; leave
   empty when unclear — never guess). The subject's law is the `Tasks` policy standard in
   the policy-standards registry (pointer on the `tasks` target in targets.md); the write
   discipline's fetch-policy step applies. NEVER set `Prime Agent` (deprecated — a dupe of
   the Project/Org links; the policy standard records this). The live board has NO
   Priority/Tag/Summary/Due field — don't try to set them (see Gotchas; targets.md records
   the live-verified schema).
2. **Resolve:** `Assigned To` (and `Client Contact` if named) via `Notion:notion-get-users`
   ("me" → the user's email → their id); `Project` via search; `Next Action` is the date
   field — pin relative dates. Target `tasks`.

## Gotchas
Shared write-discipline gotchas live in the `writing-records-to-notion` standard;
task-specific ones only:
- (live 2026-07-13) The live [DB] Tasks schema differs from the March Standards page
  (no Priority/Tag/Summary/Due; `Name` not "Task Name"; `Assigned To`; `Next Action` date;
  Status starts at To Do). Fetch live; never trust the Standards page as the schema.
- (baseline) "next Friday" is ambiguous (nearest vs following week) — pin `Next Action` to
  a concrete date and confirm when it's close; never store a relative phrase.
- (pressure) `get-users` may return multiple people or a bot — email→id isn't always 1:1;
  confirm the right person before using an id, don't grab the first match.
