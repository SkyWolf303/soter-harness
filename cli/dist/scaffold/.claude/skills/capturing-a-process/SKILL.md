  Captures a repeatable process as a [DB] Process Inventory entry — row per the live
  schema, body per the process shape standard, de-duped and confirmed before the write.
  Use to capture, document, or define a process. Not for tasks (/capturing-a-task),
  features (/capturing-a-feature), or write mechanics (/pushing-to-notion).

# Capturing a process

## Goal
A described process becomes one [DB] Process Inventory entry — its row shaped to the live
schema (options matched, Related Service resolved or empty), its body shaped into steps and
work-items per `shaping-a-process`, de-duped and confirmed — at Status = Draft (unless told
otherwise).

## Use when / don't use when
- Use when: turning a described repeatable process into a documented Process Inventory entry.
- Not for: capturing a task (`/capturing-a-task`) or feature (`/capturing-a-feature`); the
  Notion write mechanics (`/pushing-to-notion`); auditing a schema doc
  (`/auditing-a-schema-doc`). The body *shape* is defined in `shaping-a-process`; this guide
  captures an entry to that shape.

## Steps
Follow the **`writing-records-to-notion`** standard
(`.claude/standards/writing-records-to-notion.md`) for the shared spine — fetch schema ·
resolve relations (never fabricate) · match options · de-dup · confirm · publish via the
binding. Process-specific:
1. **Shape the row from the live schema** — the property registry lives with the
   `process-inventory` target, not here. `Status` defaults to `Draft` at capture unless the
   user states otherwise. Set only fields the user gives; match every select/multi_select
   to a LIVE option (`Category` and `Tags` have large sets — fetch live, never invent).
   Don't silently default a field — flag any you propose.
2. **Resolve `Related Service`** by searching the Services Catalog for the named service →
   its page id; if not found, ask (leave empty vs create-first) — never fabricate an id.
3. **Shape the body per `shaping-a-process`** (`.claude/standards/shaping-a-process.md`):
   fetch the live default template body first, then follow the standard — Purpose · Trigger
   (prose intro + objective tagged conditions) · Cadence · Roles · **Initialization** (a
   section, not a step: the run entry, its Roles map, its declared Inputs) · role-bounded
   **Steps** (narrative intro; work-items as a short bold sentence + capability-keyed
   prose line; record-writes and evidence captures carry their fields as the standard
   field table — copy the mold's table; no example values; `⤷ condition → En` pointers) ·
   Exception Handling · Post Run Summary Report (declares the run field's line items).
   FLEX: which recommended sections apply — but Purpose, Initialization, Steps, and their
   work-items are always present. A reused sequence is a subprocess (ADR-0032): its home
   starts from the [Subprocess Template]; callers carry it in full, with NO provenance
   aside (ADR-0038) — adopting it means entering the home's Used By in the same change.
4. **De-dup:** search [DB] Process Inventory by name before creating; an existing entry is
   updated (`/updating-a-notion-page`), not duplicated.
5. **Confirm** the resolved row (matched options, resolved-or-empty Related Service, flagged
   defaults) + the step/work-item outline, then create via `/pushing-to-notion`. Verify the
   entry exists with the shaped body.

## Gotchas
Shared write-discipline gotchas live in the `writing-records-to-notion` standard;
process-specific ones only:
- (live 2026-07-14) `Status` is a pure lifecycle (Backlog · Up Next · Draft · In Review ·
  Active · Retired); `ProcessOS` (Not Ready · Ready · Live) and `Prio` are SEPARATE fields —
  never encode adoption stage or priority into Status. (The old `Maturity` field was dropped.)
- (convergence) Source bodies and older docs label the stage grouping with a different word;
  the canonical shape is **steps** holding **work-items** (ADR-0019) — normalize to steps,
  don't copy the source's label.
- (invariant) Work-items are body checkboxes, NOT [DB] Tasks rows — capturing a process never
  creates tasks. A run's work-items become [DB] Tasks later via `/capturing-a-task` (the
  run→tasks seam); don't fabricate task ids here.
- (pressure) `Category` / `Tags` are large live option sets — a value that only *sounds*
  right (e.g. "Ops") is rejected or makes a junk option; match the live option exactly or
  leave it empty and ask.
