  Keeps a subject's policy-standard Fields section and targets.md mirror true to the
  live DB, drift reconciled through a human gate. Use to audit, reconcile, or fix a
  schema doc or push target. Not for writing records (the capturing guides) or
  authoring a policy standard (/authoring-a-policy-standard).

# Auditing a schema doc

## Goal
A schema doc reconciled to the live DB — every field diffed, renames confirmed not assumed,
not-yet-built fields quarantined not deleted, the callout made true — via surgical,
human-gated edits that leave the doc's other sections untouched; the DB's `targets.md`
entry diffed against the same live fetch, so the harness mirror never rots unnoticed.

## Use when / don't use when
- Use when: checking or reconciling a DB's schema doc against its live schema.
- Not for: writing records (the `capturing-*` guides); the write mechanics
  (`/updating-a-notion-page`); editing the doc's prose sections (Purpose/Views/Templates).

## Steps
Any write follows the **`writing-records-to-notion`** standard
(`.claude/standards/writing-records-to-notion.md`) — confirm, then write via the update
binding. Audit-specific:
1. **Fetch BOTH live** — the live DB schema AND the schema doc's documented fields. Never
   diff against a cached/assumed schema (ADR-0016). A self-attesting "✅ Consistent"
   callout is exactly what the audit exists to falsify — never trust it as evidence.
2. **Diff every field, both directions, by PROPERTY ID not label.** For
   select/status/multi_select, compare the OPTION SETS option-by-option (a field named
   identically — e.g. `Status` — can still have different options; comparison is
   case-sensitive). Classify each field: match · missing-from-doc · extra-in-doc ·
   type/option/writability mismatch · rename-candidate.
3. **Renames need confirmation.** A label-only match (`Assignee`↔`Assigned To`) or a
   same-type/different-meaning pair (`Due`↔`Next Action`) is a CANDIDATE, not a fact —
   compare property IDs where available; ask the human, don't silently equate them.
4. **Never silent-delete an "extra" doc field.** A doc field absent from live may be
   roadmap intent (Priority/Tag/Summary) — quarantine it to a clearly-labeled "Documented
   but not built" area; only the human decides a real deletion.
5. **Record writability + type.** A read-only/rollup field documented as a writable
   relation misleads every downstream writer — mark writability, not just type. Decide once
   (with the user) whether auto fields (Created/Last edited) are documented at all.
6. **Diff the harness mirror in the same pass.** If the DB is a registered push target
   (`.claude/skills/pushing-to-notion/targets.md`), diff that target entry against the
   SAME live fetch — properties, option lists, relation targets, template notes, and the
   `live-verified` stamp. A DB with a schema doc but no target entry (or vice versa) is
   itself a finding, not a skip. The mirror's fix is a repo edit landing through the
   harness gate (branch/PR), never a Notion write. **Registered templates are part of
   the mirror:** for each template the target entry documents, fetch the template page
   live — checking the fetch's "as of" stamp is current FIRST — and verify it exists at
   the documented id, its body carries the sections its policy's body-shape rule
   declares (present, in order), and it sets no property value absent from the live
   option set. A drifted template's fix is a gated Notion edit, like the doc's.
7. **Report + propose surgical edits.** Present the full diff — doc and mirror. Propose
   edits to the Fields section ONLY — leave every other section untouched (in a policy
   standard: Definition/Classifications/Rules/Lifecycle are policy content, not schema; in
   a legacy Standards page: Purpose/Views/Templates) — plus correcting any freshness
   callout the doc carries ("⚠️ Drifted — N fields out of sync; re-audited `<date>`").
   Sweep the non-field sections for references to dead fields (a rule enforced by a
   deleted field, a view grouped by one) and flag them — don't edit them here.
8. **Reconcile on the human okay** — via `/updating-a-notion-page` (fetch-merge-write,
   surgical) for the doc; a scoped commit for the mirror. Never overwrite the whole page.
   Under "don't make me review" pressure, keep the gate but make it cheap — FLEX: how far
   to compress the review, anywhere from the full diff to a tight summary, but the
   decisions that need a human (rename confirmations, delete-vs-quarantine) always reach
   them explicitly.

## Gotchas
- (baseline) `Status` "matches" by name but not options — compare option sets
  option-by-option, case-sensitive; name-only matching hides the worst drift.
- (baseline) Rename vs delete+add is unknowable from labels alone — use property IDs; a
  label match is a candidate to confirm, and same-type/different-meaning (Due↔Next Action)
  is the trap.
- (baseline) Never silent-delete an "extra" field — it may be roadmap; quarantine it.
- (baseline) A false "✅ Consistent" callout must be corrected — non-optional; left alone
  it actively lies to the team.
- (baseline) Surgical edits only — rewriting the Fields table clobbers the doc's other
  sections.
- (live run 2026-07-13, real Tasks + Projects docs) `updating-a-notion-page`'s
  `update_content` does true surgical search-replace — proven end-to-end on a FULL
  reconciliation of two real docs: field-row removes/adds, whole option-table swaps, and
  prose fixes all matched the fetched `<td>...</td>` table format, and every unrelated
  section stayed byte-for-byte. Batch many edits in one call (atomic — one mismatch fails
  the whole call, so no half-writes). Caveat: it edits TEXT, not a callout's color/type —
  a green "✅" callout can be made to SAY "⚠️ Drifted" yet stays green; note the color
  caveat or use block-level ops to recolor.
- (live run 2026-07-15, docs audit) the page fetch served a ~90-minute-old CACHED
  snapshot — its "as of" stamp predated the audit, so a just-made edit could hide
  behind the cache while the audit claims currency. Check the fetch's "as of"
  timestamp and record it as the audit's evidence stamp; if it predates a known
  recent write, re-fetch before diffing. Same-day consequence observed: the first
  registered-template sweep returned a false "missing section" HIGH finding — a
  fresh fetch showed the section present all along.
