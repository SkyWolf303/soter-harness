# Shaping a process

## The model
A process definition is one [DB] Process Inventory entry: its metadata lives in the **row**,
its runbook in the **body**. Keep the body lean — the essentials needed to run it — and add
heavier sections only when a real process forces them (ADR-0019; minimum viable, grows).

**Row** — set the known row properties, each matched to a live option; the property
registry lives with the `process-inventory` target, not here.

**Body — the lean core (always):**
- **Purpose** — what the process produces or verifies, and why (1–3 lines).
- **Trigger** — a 1–3 line prose intro (how the need arrives in practice, including any
  method-selection context), then one tagged line per trigger: `<kind>` — <condition>.
  Kinds: `Request` (someone asks) · `Event` (observed state demands a run) · `Schedule` ·
  `Emergency` — the kind is backticked, no colon after it, and honest about who/what
  initiates. The backticks carry the kind ALONE — a qualifier or sub-label never joins
  it (observed live 2026-07-14: `Event — unverified destination`); the qualifier belongs
  in the condition text, and same-kind triggers repeat as separate lines. Each tagged
  line is an OBJECTIVE condition checkable true/false; assumptions,
  advice, and process notes never live here (a real precondition goes to Prerequisites).
- **Steps** — role-bounded: `### Step N — (Role) <objective>`. One role owns a step, so
  each step transition is a role handoff — that handoff IS the gate; no separate gate
  lines. Each step opens with a 1–3 line narrative intro: how the work actually arrives
  and what the step accomplishes — plain, concrete, never flowery, never restating the
  Trigger. Work-items are `- [ ]` checkboxes: a SHORT bold sentence as the headline; the
  how goes in prose on its own indented line under it — opening with the exercised
  capability in backticks (`Ops`, `Signer`, …) where a formal capability applies — never
  run-on after the bold; no citation tags. Prose is plain full sentences — no arrow
  shorthand (determination arrows inside tables are the one exception). A
  **record-write or evidence-capture work-item** (one per record written or evidence
  block filled) carries its fields as a page TABLE under the parent — fit-page-width,
  with the mold's column proportions (narrow ☐ · Field · Type · Required, wide
  Instruction, medium Why; copy the mold's table rather than rebuilding it) — columns
  ☐ · Field · Type · Required · Instruction · Why: ☐ is a glyph (ticking happens on the
  run or its form — the doc is a read-do script); Field is the live field name in plain
  text (never backticks); Type is the concrete input shape (select · relation → its target · file +
  accepted formats · text · checkbox · URL); Instruction is the plain what-to-do — one
  lead sentence, then `• ` bullets for determinations (evidence → **Value**), value
  lists, and `⤷ condition → En` pointers; Why is the operator-facing reason the field
  matters — exactness dicta (verbatim, in full, never truncated) live in Why, never in
  Instruction. A value convention is written in italics (*[Org] [Program]*), never in
  backticks; a PREDETERMINED literal the operator enters as-is (`In Progress`,
  `Today's date`, the linked process's own name) IS backticked, inside the Instruction.
  A value list ends with a bare @-mention of the owning policy as its
  terminal bullet — `(@ <policy> — add/change enum options)` — the ONE permitted inline
  policy pointer: a locator for the option set's home, never narration (scoped exception
  to ADR-0038's no-pointer rule). Work-items carry NO example values — an `e.g.`
  literal reads as THE input at run time; worked examples live in the subject's policy
  standard or on real records. Plain operator language only — write "add it if it is not
  on file", never harness jargon like resolve-or-create.
  A **write work-item** mention-links its target database and carries the operator-facing
  how INLINE — imperatives, the current value list, determinations — so a run needs only
  the process doc (ADR-0023). An expanding set (naming convention, function list) is
  copied as the CURRENT rule or values ONLY — no inline policy pointer, citation, or
  governance narration ("managed in the X policy", "V2 in the Y policy", "developing
  rule", "the list expands"): the row's `Related Policies` relation declares the
  governing policies structurally (dual — each policy lists the processes it
  governs), and the law (rules, rationale, extension criteria) is never copied
  (ADR-0021, ADR-0038; observed live 2026-07-14: pointer lines kept regrowing
  policy-side commentary, so the linkage moved off the page entirely).
  Prerequisites resolve-or-create through the subject's own owner.
  A reused SEQUENCE (subprocess) has one canonical home — its own inventory entry whose
  Used By section lists every carrier; callers carry the flow IN FULL, adapted to their
  parameters, never as a pointer-only reference (a run needs only the process doc) and
  with no carrier-side provenance aside — the home's Used By section is the linkage
  ledger (ADR-0038 amends ADR-0032's provenance line away). A change to the home
  updates every Used By carrier in the same change (ADR-0032). A home binds slots or
  roles: a directory role it always needs binds like any process (entering Related
  Roles); where the role is the caller's to choose, its Roles section defines a
  capability-bound SLOT (required capabilities, no @-mention, never in Related Roles) —
  the calling process's Roles table binds each slot to one of its own directory roles
  (ADR-0043). A home starts from the live [Subprocess Template]: its Initialization
  declares only the caller-supplied inputs (no run entry, no role assignment — the
  calling run already exists), and evidence lands on the calling run.

- **Initialization** — its own section between Roles and Steps (NOT a step: it captures
  run metadata, not domain work), owned by whichever role receives the trigger: ONE
  record-write work-item creating the run entry in [DB] Process Runs, its fields in the
  standard field table (Name · Process · Roles · Inputs · Started · State). The `Roles`
  row's instruction lists one bullet per role from the Roles table, each an @-mention of
  the person's [DB] Contacts record (external counterparties are roles too); the
  `Inputs` row's bullets are one per input — those bullets ARE the process's input
  declaration; @-mention the input's record where one exists, raw value otherwise,
  upgraded to the mention once registered. The FINAL
  step closes the run (Completed · State · Outcome · the Post Run Summary Report field).
  Working detail accrues in the run's page body per the [Run Template] (Run · Inputs ·
  Outputs & Proof) — one parent bullet per artifact, one FACT per nested bullet, never
  facts chained inline with `·`; proof lands there as the run progresses; the Post Run
  Summary Report field carries one line per field the process's Post Run Summary Report
  section declares. Identifiers are never truncated — full value, linked to the canonical
  source (explorer, record) where one exists. When the process verifies a subject
  record, that record links the run.

**Recommended (light):**
- **Cadence** — one line, mirrors the `Frequency` property.
- **Roles** — two columns, Role · Responsibility: the Role cell @-mentions the [DB]
  Roles row (a new role is defined in the directory FIRST). The Responsibility cell is
  one dash-line per responsibility, keyed by the capability it exercises —
  **Capability** — responsibility, multiple capabilities joined with `·`; EVERY
  responsibility carries its key, external roles included (externals exercise
  capabilities from their own side); a keyless line means the wrong role owns it
  or a capability is missing — define it policy-first; process-specific
  constraints inline. Role-level facts — the capability LIST, definition, who holds
  it — live on the directory row: a capability appears in the table only as the key of
  a responsibility using it, never as the role's list (no Who column; ADR-0043). The
  row's `Related Roles` relation mirrors the table. The step headings bind to these
  roles, so the table exists whenever steps do.
- **Exception Handling** — labeled exceptions (**E1, E2, …**), each failure → workaround,
  defined once here; a work-item that can trigger one carries an inline `⤷ condition → En`
  pointer instead of restating the handling.
- **Post Run Summary Report** — the doc section DECLARES the run field's line items (as
  Initialization declares inputs): the structured facts this process's close-out must
  record, one line per field, filled at close. Working detail lives in the run body
  (Run Log) — deliberately NOT in [DB] Tasks rows.

**Add later, as the process firms up (not needed for a first version):** Prerequisites ·
Resources · Inputs & Outputs · Sub-process rules · Connections · Improvement opportunities ·
Notes · Change Log.

Vocabulary: **steps** (never `phases`), **work-items** (never `tasks` — a work-item is the
process concept, deliberately not a [DB] Tasks row). Fetch the live default template body
before shaping — don't invent the section set (ADR-0016).

## Use when / don't
- Applies when: shaping or reviewing the *body* of a [DB] Process Inventory entry.
- Doesn't apply when: the Notion *write mechanics* (`writing-records-to-notion` +
  `/pushing-to-notion`); the entry's row *properties* and option sets (the `process-inventory`
  target in `targets.md`); auditing a schema *doc* against its live DB
  (`auditing-a-schema-doc`); capturing a task or a feature (their own guides).
